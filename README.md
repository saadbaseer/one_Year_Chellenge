1YearPlan
This repository documents my daily programming tasks and projects as I progress through my 2025 learning roadmap. Each folder represents a week and includes well-organized code, solutions, and mini-projects.

Daily Programming Tasks Repository
Welcome to my Daily Programming Tasks repository! This is a detailed record of my day-by-day journey in mastering programming, data structures, algorithms, and machine learning, based on my 2025 learning roadmap.

📖 Overview
This repository serves as:

A tracker for my daily tasks and solutions.
A collection of mini-projects and exercises.
A reference for anyone learning programming step by step.
🗓️ Learning Roadmap
I am following a structured 1-year plan with weekly milestones:

Week 1: Introduction to C++ (Basics, Loops, Problem Solving).
Week 2: Python Basics.
Week 3: Problem Solving with Python.
...and many more milestones, culminating in advanced topics like Neural Networks, GANs, and Deployment.
📁 Repository Structure
Each week has its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:

Day-wise Solutions: Programs completed as part of daily tasks.
Mini-Projects: Weekly projects to reinforce learning.
Documentation: Notes and references for key concepts.
🌟 Highlights

Daily progress tracking.
Solutions to beginner and intermediate problems.
Mini-projects showcasing practical applications.
🚀 Goals
By the end of 2025, I aim to:

Build a strong foundation in programming (C++ & Python).
Solve over 100 coding problems on platforms like HackerRank.
Develop a portfolio with 5-6 major projects.
Transition into advanced topics like machine learning and AI.
