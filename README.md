🌟 1YearPlan
This repository contains my daily programming tasks and projects as I progress through my 2025 learning roadmap. Each folder corresponds to a week and includes well-documented code, solutions, and mini-projects.

🎯 Daily Programming Tasks Repository
Welcome to my Daily Programming Tasks repository!
This repository tracks my day-by-day progress as I follow my 2025 learning roadmap to master:

Programming
Data structures
Algorithms
Machine learning
📖 Overview
This repository serves as:
✅ A place to track my daily tasks and solutions
✅ A showcase of mini-projects and exercises
✅ A step-by-step guide for anyone learning programming

🗓️ Learning Roadmap
I am following a structured 1-year plan with weekly milestones:

📌 Week 1: Introduction to C++ (Basics, Loops, Problem Solving)
📌 Week 2: Python Basics
📌 Week 3: Problem Solving with Python
📌 ...and more, leading to advanced topics like Neural Networks, GANs, and Deployment

📂 Repository Structure
Each week has its own folder containing:

📄 Day-wise Solutions: Programs written for daily tasks
🔧 Mini-Projects: Weekly projects to consolidate learning
📝 Documentation: Notes and references for understanding concepts
🌟 Highlights
✨ Daily progress tracking to maintain consistency
✨ Solutions to beginner and intermediate-level problems
✨ Mini-projects to demonstrate practical application of concepts

🚀 Goals
By the end of 2025, I aim to:
🏆 Build a strong foundation in programming (C++ & Python)
🏆 Solve 100+ coding problems on platforms like HackerRank
🏆 Create a portfolio with 5-6 major projects
🏆 Transition into advanced topics like machine learning and AI
